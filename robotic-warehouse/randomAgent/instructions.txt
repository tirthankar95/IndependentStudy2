TL;DR Downgrade your setuptools==65.5.0 and wheel<0.40.0
!pip install setuptools==65.5.0 "wheel<0.40.0"
Details:
The issue here seems to be related to wheel (0.40.0+) and setuptools (66.0.0+) that is now reporting a version string in gym==0.21.0's setup file as no longer valid. The following traceback comes from building wheel for Gym as reported in Github #3202 for gym
...
wheel.vendored.packaging.requirements.InvalidRequirement: Expected end or semicolon (after version specifier)
opencv-python>=3.
which refers to opencv-python>=3. string in the setup.py. It would appear that newer versions of wheel is raising errors here.
One workaround that you can find in Github issue #3211 is to downgrade the versions of setuptools and wheel, as in:

!pip install setuptools==65.5.0 "wheel<0.40.0"

After restarting the kernel, you should be able to run:

!pip install gym==0.21.0
